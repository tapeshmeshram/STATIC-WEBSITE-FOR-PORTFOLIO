This task involved creating a static developer portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective was to build a personal webpage that introduces me as a developer, displays my technical skills, highlights my key projects, and provides ways for others to contact me. The entire website is static, meaning it does not require any backend or database. The layout includes multiple sections such as an "About Me" section, a "Skills" section that lists technologies I know, a "Projects" section describing real applications I’ve worked on, and a "Contact" section containing my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links. There is also a button that allows visitors to download my resume directly from the site.

The design uses modern UI/UX principles. The website is fully responsive, so it works smoothly on mobile devices and desktops. Media queries are used in CSS to adjust the layout based on screen size. I also used icons from Font Awesome to enhance the look and user experience. Styling was done with CSS3, including transitions and hover effects for better interaction. The navigation bar is sticky, which helps users access different sections of the page easily.

Projects shown in the portfolio include “Quiz Master,” a full-stack quiz app using Flask and SQLite; “Digital Closet Planner,” a Java-based wardrobe organizer; and a “Health Monitoring App for Senior Citizens,” a C-language menu-driven tool for simple health tracking. Each project includes a description and the technologies used to build it.

This project helped me improve my frontend development skills and understand responsive layout design more clearly. It also taught me how to present technical content effectively. The final output is a neat, professional-looking portfolio site that I can use for job applications or personal branding.
